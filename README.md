# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Duc Hoang

## About Me

I am a Data Science enthusiast with a strong interest in the Fintech sector. Over the course of my journey, I have developed a passion for solving complex problems by leveraging my skills in analytics and computing, always seeking to unlock value and drive growth through the power of data.

I am multilingual, fluent in Vietnamese, English, and Japanese. This not only allows me to engage with a diverse range of cultures and individuals but also gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving in an increasingly globalized world.

When I'm not crunching numbers or diving into the latest data science tools, I enjoy spending my free time playing volleyball and chess. Both these activities challenge me in different ways - volleyball for teamwork and physical endurance, and chess for strategic thinking and patience.
